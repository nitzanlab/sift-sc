What is SiFT?
-------------
A computational framework which aims to uncover the underlying structure by filtering out previously exposed biological
signals.

`SiFT` can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from (i) the removal of unwanted variation as a pre-processing step,
through (ii) revealing hidden biological structure by utilizing prior knowledge with respect to existing signal,
to (iii) uncovering trajectories of interest using reference data to remove unwanted variation.
